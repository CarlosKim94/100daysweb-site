Summary: This is a summary of the first post written for our Pelican Blog. We're using this for the 100daysofweb course.

##Big heading for a big day!

This is the first paragraph of our article - huzzah!

We're writing this in Markdown format so we can use two * symbols to indicate a **bold** formatted block of text.

###A slightly smaller header...

We can also use a single * around a block of text to indicate an *italicised* word.
